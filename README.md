# Python-for-Kids

In this repository I collect the materials used for the tutoring sessions for an 11 year old. 

## Lecture 0

A typical setup for the environment.

## Lecture 1

First three videos of the [Hello! Programming with Python for Kids and Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODtS3S1ffE&list=PL7wwY6Ln64K4Ev1KQMNwudrh4YqtCTHf3) was followed.

We talked about precedence and variables.

## Lecture 2

We talked about placeholders and variables. Three main types of variables (integer, string, boolean) in Python are introduced.

## Lecture 3

We talked about for loop and if conditional statments.

Examples from the following link were used: [Python for Kids â€“ Fun Tutorial to Learn Python Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-for-kids/)

## Lecture 4

Introduction to modules through turtle module of Python. Sixth video of the [Hello! Programming with Python for Kids and Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODtS3S1ffE&list=PL7wwY6Ln64K4Ev1KQMNwudrh4YqtCTHf3) was practiced.

## Lecture 5

The loop structure is brought together with the turtle module to draw polygons. Furthermore, nested loop structures are introduced by drawing clover shapes.

## Lecture 6

Various functions to draw certain shapes using turtle module have been created. We switched to using PyCharm IDE.

## Lecture 7

We have written a complete program to draw triangle, square, or a pentagon with a given side length.

## Lecture 8

We have made previous program significantly smaller by for loop structure.
